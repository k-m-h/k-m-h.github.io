        <h3>Summary of Findings</h3>
        <p>This proccess of research and testing has provided the foundation for
             the usability of this site.  Through inital User Research, I was able
             to prioritize the feaures of the portfolio into approcheable segments.
             Through competitor analysis, I was able to visualize the look and feel
             of the site that I was hoping to achieve as well how that type of
             design would translate to site components and content structuring.
             This made it easier to start sketching out the overall layout for the
             site.  By keeping responsive design in the forefront, I was able to
             find layouts for the content that worked with varying screen sizes
             and user contexts.  </p>
        <p>Once the site had a working prototype, I was able to begin User Testing
            which exposed a whole new layer to my understanding of the user experience
            on this portfolio.  For example, in my prototype, ym email and phone
            number were both clickable links.  If a user clicke don the email
            address, it would launch the default email client for that device.
            My orginial concern with this feature would be that users would not
            trust this clickable link because they might not know what to expect
            from it and therefore not use it.  My user testing however reavealed
            that most user were aware of what clicking the link would do but still
            prefered to manually copy and paste the address.  The reason that was
            that most users did not actually use the default email client on their
            device and instead would have preferd to use the web client through their
            browser.</p>
        <h3>Incorporation of Findings</h3>
        <p>Thanks to user research and testing, I was able to come up with many
            solutions for improving the usbaility of my portfoilio website.  One
            example of this is the solution I implemented for the email link issue
            described above in the Summary of Findings.  </p>
